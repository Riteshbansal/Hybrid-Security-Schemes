# [Comparison of Hybrid Security Schemes: A Survey](http://www.earticle.net/Article.aspx?sn=284937)
>In todayâ€™s age, communication through internet has become inseparable entity of many applications. These applications often require secrecy of data to be transmitted for security reasons. Therefore, commonly used security mechanisms such as cryptography and steganography can be employedto provide security, however using these techniques standalone often poses security threats. Therefore, a hybrid approach can be used for improving security features. In this paper comparison is drawn of recently published hybrid security mechanisms on the basis of following parameters: Visual assessment, Encrypted code Analysis, Similarity Analysis, Peak Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR), Information Entropy Analysis, Embedding Capacity Analysis, Key space analysis. The schemes are implemented and comparedusing MATLAB-2015
